# Hello

My name is Zakarya Lasmar, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at [IonQ Inc](https://ionq.com/) based in Toronto, Canada. 

### This repository

The purpose of this repository is to show my progress in coding. The projects here are:

- [movie industry - Python](https://github.com/Zak-Las/Portfolio-DataProjects/tree/main/movie%20industry%20-%20Python): Here I clean and perform an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of movies from imdb.
- [world life expectancy - PostgreSQL](https://github.com/Zak-Las/Portfolio-DataProjects/tree/main/world%20life%20expectancy%20-%20PostgreSQL): Here I clean and perform an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of the world life expectancy.
- [automated data cleaning - MySQL](https://github.com/Zak-Las/Portfolio-DataProjects/tree/main/automated%20data%20cleaning%20-%20MySQL): Here I use Stored Procedures, Triggers, and Events to automatically clean raw data.
- [regeression modeling of insurance claims - Python](https://github.com/Zak-Las/Portfolio-DataProjects/tree/main/predicting%20insurance%20claims%20-%20Regeression%20Modeling): Here I create a model using two different tools/packages (statsmodels + scikit-learn) to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their insurance during the policy period.

But in short, I have worked on different projects on:

## Quantum:

+ I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [IonQ Inc](https://ionq.com/), where I lead the development of a simulation tool used to model the physics of a quantum system that serves as a building block for the companyâ€™s quantum computers.
  - I also developed a framework for analyzing resource estimates for quantum computers, enabling more informed design and scalability assessments.
+ In my previous role as a postdoctoral researcher at [the Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT)](https://www.cqt.sg), I led multiple research projects focused on quantum devices.
  - In collaboration with experimentalists, I developed a novel method for generating quantum correlations between spatially separated atoms.
+ In my PhD research:
  - I developed theoretical description of many-body quantum systems and how quantum correlations can affect their dynamics.
  - I conducted simulated experiments using Mathematica, Python, and MATLAB.
