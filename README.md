# Hello

My name is Zakarya Lasmar, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at [IonQ Inc](https://ionq.com/) based in Toronto, Canada. 

### This repository

The purpose of this repository is to show my progress in coding. The projects here are:

- [movies performance - Python](https://github.com/Zak-Las/Portfolio-DataProjects/tree/main/movies%20performance%20-%20Python): Here I clean and perform an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of movies from imdb.
- [world life expectancy - PostgreSQL](https://github.com/Zak-Las/Portfolio-DataProjects/tree/main/world%20life%20expectancy%20-%20PostgreSQL): Here I clean and perform an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of the world life expectancy.

But in short, I have worked on different projects on:

## Quantum:

+ I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [IonQ Inc](https://ionq.com/), where I lead the development of a simulation tool used to model the physics of a quantum system that serves as a building block for the companyâ€™s quantum computers.
  - I also developed a framework for analyzing resource estimates for quantum computers, enabling more informed design and scalability assessments.
+ In my previous role as a postdoctoral researcher at [the Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT)](https://www.cqt.sg), I led multiple research projects focused on quantum devices.
  - In collaboration with experimentalists, I developed a novel method for generating quantum correlations between spatially separated atoms.
+ In my PhD research:
  - I developed theoretical description of many-body quantum systems and how quantum correlations can affect their dynamics.
  - I conducted simulated experiments using Mathematica, Python, and MATLAB.

## Publications

You can also view my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fwOde-oAAAAJ&hl=en), which primarily focus on quantum correlations and atomic physics.
